									<h1>Tomb For<br />
									Two</h1>
									<p>
										Tomb for Two is a local 2-player dungeon crawler where Anubis and Bastet have been trapped in a pyramid. 
										Set in a far-off futuristic world, the two players must escape the pyramid by defeating enemies 
										and solving puzzles together. 
										<br/> 
										<br/> 
										On this project, I worked on certain enemy aspects, including an entire enemy type, 
										as well as all of player movement.

										<!--Movement-->
										<h2>Movement</h2>
										<p>
											Tomb for Two features pretty standard player movement. You can move around with the WASD keys
											or the left joystick. You can also dash by pressing space on keyboard, or A on controller. In addition,
											I coded the player turning for mouse/keyboard. 
										</p>
										<p>
											The movement is a basic Transform update on the player's model, and was some of the first code I ever wrote
											in Unity C#. It utilizes Unity's new Input System to detect player input, as does the dash mechanic. The dash mechanic
											works by first stripping the player of regular movement controls. It then applies an impulse to the player model in the direction
											that they were moving using Unity's Rigidbody.AddForce() function.
										</p>

										<br/>

										<p>
											Both player movement and dashing get overriden when a player steps onto an ice puzzle, which I coded completely on my own.
											It utilizes Unity's OnCollisionEnter events to detect when a player steps onto an ice puzzle, which sets the player into a
											special state. In this state, the player is only allowed to move along the X and Z axes. When they move in a direction,
											a velocity is placed onto the player model in that direction until they hit a wall. Hit detection is done through a Spherecast
											just in front of the player along the axes on which they are moving. If the Spherecast detects a Collider with a specific Tag,
											it lets the controller know that the player needs to be stopped, and can choose a new direction to move in.
										</p>

										<!--Enemies-->
										<h2>Enemies</h2>
										<p>
											The enemies in Tomb For Two are credited largely to my teammate Nick Fraus, who did the majority of the work on them.
											I did, however, have my contributions.
										</p>
										<p>
											Certain subclasses of enemies have the ability to stun the player, leaving them unable to move or attack. They can, however,
											free themselves by dashing. Based on this synergy, it made sense that I would work on creating the "stunned" player state, as well as coupling
											it with the dash mechanic. Players are also granted invulnerability from any damage or stuns while dashing.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition to working with enemy stun, I also created a few enemy types of my own. One of these types is the Priest,
											which is a passive and tanky enemy that wanders the pyramid, granting any fellow enemies in its radius invincibility.
											To defeat enemies caught in the Priest's sandtrap, players must either lure enemies out of the priest's range, or defeat
											the priest itself.
										</p>

										<video controls loop>
											<source src="images/MP4s/TFTPriest.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<br/>

										<p>
											While most of the base Enemy code was already laid out, I took the opportunity to learn about how the enemies in our game
											worked, which meant learning about Unity's NavMesh, NavMesh Agents, and various Physics functions.
										</p>
										<p>
											Another aspect of Tomb for Two enemies I contributed to are the enemy shields. Any enemy can be shielded,
											which means that they can only be damaged by melee attacks. To get this working meant diving into the player
											projectile code and adding a check in the OnCollisionEnter function. It also meant creating a new enemy state.
										</p>
