									<h1>Sneakeasy</h1>
									<p>
										Sneakeasy is a 2D, side-scrolling, stealth platformer in which you play as a thief completing a heist in a 1920s, 
                                        retro-futuristic world while using parkour movements and EMP grenades to evade robotic guards. 
                                        Platform, parkour, and pilfer your way to victory to steal a diamond from Goliath Inc! 
										<br/> 
										<br/> 
										On this project, I spearheaded the team that worked on the elaborate player movement, which included
                                        quick time events (QTEs), a QTE combo system, and momentum.

										<h2>Quick Time Events</h2>
										<p>
                                            The core of Sneakeasy's gameplay lies in its fluid player movement. 
											To make that movement more engaging than simple WASD/Joystick controls, 
											my team decided to implement a quick time event (QTE) system into the game. 
											This would allow us to present obstacles to the player, who would then be able 
											to overcome them with precise timing.
                                        </p>
										<p>
											Obstacles included vaultable objects, long falls, and walls blocking the player’s path. 
											The player was then able to vault, roll, wall kick, and ledge grab their way through the environment 
											in a fluid manner, keeping their momentum where they would have otherwise lost it.
										</p>

										</video>
										<br/>

										<p>
											As the player successfully performs consecutive QTEs, they build up a “momentum combo,” 
											which stacks up to a max level of 3. The higher the momentum combo, the faster the player accelerates, 
											and the faster the player will run at their top speed.
										</p>
										<p>
											Since every QTE would increase this combo counter, each type of QTE inherits from a base QTE class, 
											which implements the functionality that we wanted all QTEs to exhibit (i.e. increasing the momentum combo on success). 
											This allowed my team to avoid repeating the same code redundantly in each derived QTE class, 
											making our code easier to write and, more importantly, easier to debug.
										</p>
										<p>
											When initially developing the QTE classes, my team and I had used Monobehaviours attached to 
											the respective GameObject that we wanted to be vaultable/rollable/etc. (quicktime-able, if you will). 
											However, as we began to add more and more of these QTE objects into our game, I realized that we’d be 
											creating a lot of Monobehaviour instances that all serve the same purpose. 
											This would leave us prone to errors and scaling issues - if a designer wanted to change the settings 
											for a certain QTE, they’d have to change those values in the inspector for <b>all</b> GameObjects with that 
											QTE’s MonoBehaviour as a component.
										</p>
										<p>
											Understanding that using Monobehaviours in that situation would not be ideal, 
											I suggested to my team that we switch QTEs over from inheriting from Monobehaviour 
											to inheriting from ScriptableObject. In doing so, we only needed <b>one instance</b> of each 
											QTE type to exist, which would contain the settings for how its respective QTE should behave <b>every time</b>. 
											This made our project a lot cleaner and kept all of our code relating to QTEs in one place, 
											making it much easier for the design team to work in our project and make changes as they saw fit.
										</p>

										<br>
										<p>
											In addition to making QTEs easy for designers to tweak, 
											my team sought to make all of player movement designer-friendly as well. 
											To accomplish this, we exposed as many core variables in the inspector as we could, 
											such as the player’s max speed, the player’s acceleration, and the player’s jump power. 
											This allowed designers to play around with values as much as they pleased, 
											streamlining the path towards a well-balanced and polished game.
