									<h1>Trick or Treat<br />
									Fighters</h1>
									<p>
										Trick Or Treat Fighters is a 2-4 player local party game in which players kick, steal, and run
										to be crowned the best trick-or-treater around! This game was submitted for one of MSU's Game
										Development courses, and won awards for <b class="msugreen-text">"Most Fun," "Most Innovative,"</b> 
										and runner-up for <b class="msugreen-text">"Best Aesthetic"</b> from a panel of alumni judges.
										<br/>
										<br/> 
										On this project, I worked on: the entirety of the menus; player movement, customization, and controls; 
										multiplayer support; combat; game state; and more!

										<h2>Movement and Combat</h2>
										<p>
											Trick or Treat Fighters (ToTF) features simple-yet-effective player movement: move your left joystick, and
											the player will move in that direction. The only exception to this is the player rotation, which occurs at a more
											gradual pace to add a feeling of smoothness. The simplicity of this movement allows the player to learn the game quickly 
											and focus on the other aspects of the game, such as the combat. 
										</p>
										<p>
											ToTF's combat is once again a simple-yet-effective system that adds a great variety of scenarios and interactivity
											into the game with only a single button. Players are able to "kick" one another in order to stop players from depositing candy
											 - the kicked player will be forced to drop a percentage of their currently carried candy, knocked back in the direction of the kick,
											and stunned for a few moments. Landing a kick is one of the most satisfying feelings in the game, especially if you manage
											to knock someone into oncoming traffic!
										</p>

										<br/>

										<p>
											To better handle the functionality of the kick, I developed a state system for the player by using 
											ScriptableObjects as enums, as outlined in 
											<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk&list=WL&index=18&ab_channel=Unity">Ryan Hipple's talk</a>.
											
											The state machine holds a reference to the player's current state object and reads which booleans are set
											to determine what actions the player can currently take.
											This architecture allowed our team to easily create new states for the player, assigning the controls allowed
											in that state by simply checking/unchecking boolean boxes in the inspector.
										</p>

										<h2>Multiplayer Support</h2>
										<p>
											ToTF features support for local multiplayer up to 4 players. While it was easy to
											set this up in a single scene by using the Unity pre-built PlayerInputManager component, getting the game
											to save player order and customization across scenes was a much more difficult task.
										</p>
										<p>
											To overcome this challenge, I again utilized ScriptableObjects to maintain the customizations 
											each player had selected, as well as a tie between those customizations and the device 
											that they were created with. This allowed me to instantiate the properly-customized character when
											the game started and pair that character with the appropriate controller.
										</p>

										<!--Menus-->
										<h2>Menus</h2>
										<p>
											I had the pleasure of implementing the entire menu system for ToTF. I utilized 
											Unity's EventSystem with the New Input System to handle the navigation of the menus,
											and Cinemachine to handle the camera panning I added to juice up the menus.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition to my usage of pre-made packages, I implemented a custom solution to
											handle saving the options that the player selected. Once again, I turned to my
											long-time friend ScriptableObjects to accomplish this. Any setting that is set/changed
											updates a corresponding value held by a ScriptableObject, a pattern again taken from
											Ryan Hipple. That value is then read by code in the scene where the gameplay occurs, which
											then updates the appropriate values accordingly. As with the aforementioned ScriptableObject-based
											systems, I found that designing the options system in this way allowed my team and I to write clean,
											modular, and easily-maintainable code.
