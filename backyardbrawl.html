										Backyard Brawl is a <b class="msugreen-text">competitive and chaotic party game</b> for <b class="msugreen-text">2-4 players</b> both <b class="msugreen-text">locally and online</b>.
										Players are pitted against one another in several gamemodes, ranging from <b class="msugreen-text">competitive trick or treating</b> to <b class="msugreen-text">laser tag soccer</b>. 
										Playing as one of <b class="msugreen-text">several cute characters</b>, players must utilize <b class="msugreen-text">power ups and

										<h2>Networking</h2>
										<p>
											Backyard Brawl is a continuation of a project started in the Fall of 2023. 
											In its initial state, the game was strictly a local multiplayer experience. 
											However, as my team and I wanted to create a commercially viable product, we 
											believed it necessary to push ourselves to network the game.
										</p>
										<p>
											Over the summer, my co-programmer and I researched and practiced with Unity's networking solution,
											<a href="https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/">Netcode for Game Objects</a>.
											We began taking some of the most basic features of the original game and implementing them in a networked state.
											This allowed us to hit the ground running with our full team once the semester began, and gave us enough
											background knowledge to not waste valuable semester time learning an entirely new system.
										</p>
										<!-- Insert video of online play? -->

										<h2>Local Multiplayer</h2>
										<p>
											After networking the game, our team realized that it was now difficult 
											to rapidly prototype new mechanics and gamemodes due to the added complexity of networking systems. 
											To alleviate this issue, I worked to reintroduce 
											local multiplayer into the game.
										</p>
										<label>

										</label>
										<p>
											I wanted to reuse as much of the networking code as possible to avoid re-coding 
											the entire game to support local. To sort of “fake it,” I started the local device 
											as a host with no open ports, so that all code relying on Networking-only functionality 
											(such as RPCs and object spawning) could still run without actually exposing the device 
											to the Internet.
										</p>
										<p>
											I also created a player data manager that unified how player data was maintained and 
											read for both local and online play. This abstracted away much of the networking-and 
											local-specific code from almost every system in the game, saving my team and I the trouble 
											of having to completely re-write each system to support local multiplayer.

										<h2>Online Fairness</h2>
										<p>
											Backyard Brawl takes a host-based networking approach, 
											meaning that one player starts a lobby (the host), and all 
											players who want to join that lobby connect to the host. 
											This is a very common approach, but caused a lot of unfair situations in our game.
										</p>
										<p>
											Our initial approach to networking had many things being done on the 
											server (host) side, with the idea that everything would be more secure 
											to prevent hackers from being able to exploit the game. This led to the 
											game feeling very unfair for anyone who wasn’t the host, with clients seeing 
											themselves get kicked by far away players, missing candy they 
											clearly ran through, and failing to kick players they were standing right next to. 
											To alleviate some of these problems, we modified 
											how we handled certain functionality to give clients more authority (at the cost of security).
											Our focus at the time was more on game functionality than game security, so we were willing to 
											make the sacrifice to improve playability.
										</p>
										<p>
											The results of the change were very positive, with clients
											being able to land hits much more reliably and candy collection feeling snappier than ever.
											While simply giving clients more authority isn't the perfect solution,
											it fit our project's needs at the time.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="outcome-text">Outcomes:</span>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Our "favor the attacker" approach made combat feel much more fair for all players</li>
											<li>Picking up collectibles felt much more satisfying</li>
										</ul>

										<!-- <video controls loop>
											<source src="images/MP4s/TTFOptions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<br/> -->
										<h2>Going Forward</h2>
										<p>
											In the future, we would like to implement more security features into 
											our game to prevent hackers from being able to do pretty much whatever 
											they want. After doing some research on it, we believe that the networking approach used
											in games like Overwatch and Rocket League would fit our game well. 
											Implementing a networking architecture like that would be a completely new
											realm for my team and I, but we know it would take our game to the next level.
										</p>

										<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Finding the balance between playability and network 
												security is very important, and a tricky one to find 
												(but very exciting once you do!)
											</li>
											<li>
												Centralizing commonly used data is very useful, especially 
												when that data could come from different places.
											</li>
										</ul>
